   * Orders media types by increasing specificity.

   * specificity: <code>*&#47;*</code>, {@code text/*}, {@code text/plain},
   * {@code text/plain;charset=utf-8}, {@code
   * text/plain;charset=utf-8;format=flowed}.
   *
   * <p>More precisely, this comparator performs the following comparisons:
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>First, media types are compared by whether they have a wildcard as
   *     their {@link MediaType#type()}, where the wildcard type
   *     <code>*&#47;*</code> is less specific than a non-wildcard type such as
   *     {@code text/*}.
   * <li>Then, media types are compared by whether they have a wildcard as their
   *     {@link MediaType#subtype()}, where a wildcard subtype such as {@code
   *     text/*} is less specific than a non-wildcard subtype such as {@code
   *     text/plain}.
   * <li>Finally, media types are compared by the total count of their {@link
   *     MediaType#parameters()}, where having fewer parameters is less specific
   *     than having more parameters.
   * </ul>
