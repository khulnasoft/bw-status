/**
 * Handles requests to determine which git commit id was used most recently in a
 * given benchmarking environment.
 *
 * <p>The request must specify the benchmarking environment in the {@code
 * environment} query parameter, like {@code ?environment=Citrine}.  Otherwise,
 * this handler responds with {@code 400 Bad Request}.
 *
 * <p>The response from this handler is {@code 200 OK} with the commit id in the
 * response body as plain text.  If there is no commit known for the given
 * environment, the response is {@code 204 No Content} with no response body.
 *
 * <p>This handler is expected to be called from the cloud benchmarking
 * environment in order to align itself with the physical benchmarking
 * environment.  An official round on the results website always includes a run
 * from both of these environments, and those runs must use the same commit of
 * the BW repository.  The physical environment runs continuously, checking out
 * the latest code from the master branch for each run, whereas the cloud
 * environment currently runs once per month.  We want to ensure that one cloud
 * run per month uses the same commit as one of the physical environment's runs,
 * meaning that pair of runs could be usable as an official round.
 *
 * <p>This handler is expected to be called by a bash script using {@code curl}.
 * Therefore, it responds in such a way that should be easy for that bash script
 * to consume -- plain text, with no parsing required.
