/**
 * Handles requests to check this application's health.  Responds with {@code

 * healthy} and {@code 503 Service Unavailable} otherwise.

 * <p>This handler is expected to be called by external monitoring tools in

 * tools to use this handler include:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>After launching this application, treating this application instance as
 *     "not started yet" until this handler produces a successful response.
 * <li>Not routing traffic from a load balancer to this application instance as
 *     long as this handler is producing non-successful responses.
 * <li>Restarting or terminating this application instance if this handler
 *     produces an unacceptable number of consecutive non-successful responses.
 * </ul>
