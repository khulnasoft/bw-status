/**
 * A representation of the results.json file from a BW run.
 *
 * <p>This class contains a subset of the fields defined in a results.json file.
 * In general, a field that is defined in results.json files will be added to
 * this class when this application uses that field, and unused fields will be
 * omitted from this class.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are deserialized from JSON.  Instances of this
 * class are serialized to JSON in tests only; the serialized form of this class
 * is never exposed to users.
 *
 * @param uuid The universally unique id for this set of results, or {@code
 *        null} if that information is unavailable.  This field was added in
 *        March 2017 and was not present in results gathered prior to that date.
 * @param name The informal name for this set of results, or {@code null} if
 *        that information is unavailable.  This field was added in March 2017
 *        and was not present in results gathered prior to that date.
 * @param environmentDescription The informal description of the environment
 *        that produced this set of results, or {@code null} if that information
 *        is unavailable.  This field was added in March 2017 and was not
 *        present in results gathered prior to that date.
 * @param startTime The epoch millisecond timestamp of when this run started, or
 *        {@code null} if that information is unavailable.  This field was added
 *        in March 2017 and was not present in results gathered prior to that
 *        date.
 * @param completionTime The epoch millisecond timestamp of when this run
 *        completed, or {@code null} if that information is unavailable.  This
 *        field was added in March 2017 and was not present in results gathered
 *        prior to that date.
 * @param duration The duration in seconds of each test.
 * @param frameworks The names of the frameworks in the run.
 * @param completed The mapping of framework names to either (a) the epoch
 *        millisecond timestamp when their tests completed, assuming their tests
 *        started successfully, or (b) an error message describing why the tests
 *        did not start.
 * @param succeeded Maps test types to the names of the frameworks that
 *        succeeded at that test type in this run.  This mapping does not take
 *        into account whether the framework achieved at least one request
 *        during the test.
 * @param failed Maps test types to the names of the frameworks that failed at
 *        that test type in this run.  This mapping does not take into account
 *        whether the framework achieved at least one request during the test.
 * @param rawData Maps test types and framework names to the list of raw results
 *        for that test type and framework.
 * @param queryIntervals The different numbers of database queries per HTTP
 *        request that were tested, for the database-related tests that vary the
 *        number of queries.
 * @param concurrencyLevels The different number of client-side request
 *        concurrency levels that were tested.
 * @param git Information about the state of the local git repository for this
 *        run, or {@code null} if the state of the git repository is unknown.
 *        This field was added in February 2018 and was not present in results
 *        gathered prior to that date.
 * @param testMetadata The test metadata, generated during this run (same as
 *        test_metadata.json).  Test metadata was not always included in the
 *        results, so this will be {@code null} for old runs.  This field was
 *        added in January 2020 and was not present in results gathered prior to
 *        that date.
