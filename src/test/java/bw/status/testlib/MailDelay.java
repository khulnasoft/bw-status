/**
 * Estimates how long it will take to send emails.

 * <p>This class may be useful in tests that (1) send email
 * <strong>asynchronously</strong>, (2) sleep, then (3) verify that the email
 * was received.  Specifically, {@link #timeToSendOneEmail()} may be used to
 * calculate how long to sleep.
 *
 * <p>In tests where the call to {@link EmailSender#sendEmail(String, String,
 * List)} is made on the current thread, there is no reason to use this class.
 * That call will block the current thread until the email is sent, so there is
 * no reason to sleep before verifying that the email was received.
